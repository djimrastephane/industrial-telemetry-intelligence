"""Per-driver health status for the industrial fleet overview.

Deterministic rules only, built entirely from existing analytics outputs.
No new statistical models or synthetic data.

Health states:
    Healthy  (Green)  – no actionable anomalies, no pit recommendation,
                        degradation risk Low or absent.
    Warning  (Amber)  – at least one partially-explained anomaly, OR an
                        active pit recommendation, OR High/Medium risk.
    Critical (Red)    – at least one unexplained anomaly OR a "Pit now"
                        recommendation.

The severity ordering is:
    Healthy < Warning < Critical

Each driver's status is the *worst* of contributions from anomalies,
recommendations, and risk scores.
